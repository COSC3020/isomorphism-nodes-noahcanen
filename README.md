# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

Let's start with the simplest graph: 2 graphs A and B, and let's assume that A and B are isomorphic.


A has two vertices, one and two. One and two are not connected by any edges.


B has one vertex, 3. 3 is not connected by any edges.


One can be mapped onto 3.


Two can be mapped onto nothing because graph B does not have another vertex to map onto.


Graphs A and B are not isomorphic because they have a different number of vertices.
