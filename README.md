# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

A one-to-one and onto function means that each node can be mapped onto a corresponding node that shares the same number of edges.


And this can only happen if two conditions are true: one, the two graphs have the same number of nodes, and two, they have the same number of edges extending from those nodes. 


Therefore, two isomorphic graphs must have the same number of vertices so that each vertex can be mapped onto a corresponding vertex in the other graph.
